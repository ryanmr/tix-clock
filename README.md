Tix Clock
=========

This is a little HTML/CSS/JS page that will make a simple tix clock on a monitor screen.

You can see the original implementation made sometime in 2009 in the "original" branch. The current implementation is partially based on that and [Savjee's more modern tix clock](http://www.savjee.be/2014/02/TixClock-clone-in-Javascript/).


There's a live version of this little clock [here](http://ifupdown.com/tixclock/).

How It Works
------------

Essentially all basic JavaScript using a few helpers from jQuery to set styles and get elements. The HTML is prewritten (unlike in the original version where it was generated on demand). The CSS has two components, a core stylesheet and a branding stylesheet to add a custom look.
