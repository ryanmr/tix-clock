Tix Clock
=========

This is a little HTML/CSS/JS page that will make a simple tix clock on a monitor screen.

You can see the original implementation made sometime in 2009 in the "original branch". The current implementation is partially based on that and [Savjee's more modern tix clock](http://www.savjee.be/2014/02/TixClock-clone-in-Javascript/).


There's a live version of this little clock [here](http://ifupdown.com/tixclock/).
